# jWatch
This is the repository for the codebase of the jWatch. All contributing code goes here. If you are interested in investing in this project (allbeit highly unlikely), shoot me an email at johnbchron@outlook.com and we'll see what we can do.

The jWatch is an esp32-based smartwatch. It will be run on a 1.3", 240x240px display, and is built to interface with an iphone's notification center.

Currently, the decision is being made between running the jWatch off of straight c (using the esp-idf), or on Arduino-generated c. It's leaning toward using the esp-idf, but this decision may change.
